# Vendor Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing **vendor performance data** to optimize procurement efficiency, enhance profitability, and strengthen supplier relationships. The aim is to generate actionable insights that help in identifying top-performing vendors, tracking profitability, and improving inventory management through an interactive dashboard.

## Problem Statement
You have been provided a dataset containing details about **vendor sales, freight costs, taxes, and profits**.  
The goal is to analyze this data to uncover insights related to:

- Vendor sales performance  
- Profitability and cost structure  
- Stock turnover efficiency  
- Order and gross profit trends  

## Key Business Questions Addressed
The project includes the creation of a dashboard and analysis to answer the following questions:

1. **Total Sales & Profit Margin**: What is the overall revenue and profit margin percentage?  
2. **Total Gross Profit**: How much gross profit was generated across all vendors?  
3. **Sales Composition**: What proportion of total sales is contributed by freight, profit, and excise tax?  
4. **Average Stock Turnover vs Target**: How efficiently is stock being utilized compared to the target rate?  
5. **Top 5 Vendors by Sales**: Which vendors have the highest total sales?  
6. **Total Sales & Average Order Value per Vendor**: How do sales and order values differ across vendors?  

## Approach
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Used Excel and Power Query to clean, merge, and preprocess vendor data for analysis.  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Built Power BI reports to analyze vendor performance metrics.  
- **KPI Tracking**: Designed key performance indicators such as total sales, profit margin, and stock turnover for monitoring business performance.  

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For interactive data visualization and KPI dashboards.  
- **Excel / Power Query**: For data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing.  
- **Data Modeling**: Created relationships between vendor, sales, and profit data for accurate metric computation.  

## Outcome
- Provided insights into vendor profitability and sales distribution.  
- Enabled data-driven decision-making for vendor management and cost optimization.  
- Improved visibility into inventory turnover and supply chain efficiency.  

## Future Work
- Implement predictive analytics to forecast vendor sales and stock needs.  
- Automate data refresh for real-time vendor performance tracking.  
- Expand dashboard with advanced cost-benefit and vendor comparison metrics.
